"The first and second interviewers were very nice and good listeners. I had a very interactive discussion with them and enjoyed it.
The third interviewer (Narayan) seems to be very busy. Not sure he was notified beforehand about the interview or not. First, he was supposed to take the second round, but he was in meeting so second round shifted to third round. Which is fine. After second round, again I had to wait for almost 1 hour, because he was still in the meeting.
When he entered the room, he seems to be still very busy. He took 10-15 minutes to start interview, looks like he was finishing off some pending work.
Then he explained the question on the whiteboard and I understood the question. He asked me to think and tell my approach first. And he went back to his work again. Then after some time I interrupted him and told about my approach then asked me to code. And he again went into his laptop.
After that, he explained to me about second question. Same process, he asked me to give approach adn went back to his work. Here genuinely, I was struggling to find right approach for this question. I needed his help. I gave him brute-force approach but that was inefficient. He asked me for an optimized one. I gave 2-3 different approaches which he listened and they won't work. I needed a little hint to go into right direction. But he was busy with his work. I mean I understand the candidate shouldn't expect the interviewer to give hints but definitely he helps. In the end, it led to rejection.
After I came home, I looked up for an answer to that question. It was not that difficult. I was just went into the wrong direction. If a little hint was given, I'm sure I could have solved it. But anyways bad day for me, I totally understand it.

I may look like sounding biased here because it led me to rejection but that was my observations and analysis. The interviewer might have different thoughts about it. In the end, I was the one who was not able to answer the question in an optimized way so I got rejected.

"I felt the interviewers are not professionally trained for interviewing. They looked like normal engineers who came to interview as an additional voluntary job. The interview process and being in an interview committee is a separate skill. The company should give some professional trainings to the interviewers. The interviewers were professional, humble and good developers with extensive knowledge, no doubt about that, but an interview is not a process of what Interviewers know but what candidate knows and is that relevant to the job requirement or is the candidate in a place to learn fast enough to adjust in the new environment.
Please don't take it in a negative sense, I assume there must be something important to tend to but an interviewer remained on his phone for 5+ minutes and I ended up not scoring enough in that round. The interviewer seemed distracted after his phone session and had already lost context of our discussion. Thankfully, I got selected so that I can tell you this, otherwise it would have never been known to you. I personally don't consider this as a negative thing, I am sure there must be some important need to attend to, but as an example, when we do it in our company, we usually take interviews in pairs (2 interviewers in the room), so that if one has to attend to something else she just walks out (with an excuse from the candidate, of course), concludes the business and comes back. Meanwhile the other interviewer is in sync and the candidate doesn't face discontinuity. It is Not Unprofessional from the interviewer, but these things can be controlled from a process perspective, and some professional training for the interviewers.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
